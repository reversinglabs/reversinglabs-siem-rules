# AgentTesla

AgentTesla is an information stealer malware that has been active since at least 2014. It is designed to collect sensitive data from infected machines and transmit that data to a command and control (C&C) server operated by the attacker. Much like other long-lived malware families, AgentTesla has evolved over the years.

AgentTesla first emerged as a keylogger that could capture and exfiltrate keystrokes from infected machines. Its early versions were somewhat rudimentary compared to its later iterations. As the years progressed, AgentTesla gained popularity among cybercriminals due to its ease of use, effectiveness, and the fact that cracked versions of its builder were circulating in underground forums. In addition to keylogging, the malware eventually added the ability to steal data from web browsers, capture clipboard data, take screenshots, and collect other system information. The primary delivery method is phishing. Attackers often use sophisticated lures such as fake invoices to entice users into executing the payload.
