# RisePro 

RisePro is a stealer malware that was first identified in 2022 and is rapidly 
gaining popularity. Operating under a malware-as-a-service model, RisePro has been
seen using PrivateLoader service to disguise itself as software cracks and game modifications.

Recent RisePro samples appear to be sharing infrastructure with other malware families,
including Amadey, RedLine, and SmokeLoader.
