# BumbleBee üêù

**Also known as:** Shindig (CrowdStrike), SHELLSTING

Bumblebee loader has been evolving since its discovery in 2020 and is a modular loader that can help attackers gain initial access to a system and infect it with additional malware or carry out ransomware attacks. It is written in C++ and uses various techniques to evade detection, such as code obfuscation and encryption. Bumblebee has been used in multiple high-profile attacks, including one against a US government agency in April 2021. Bumblebee has been seen being distributed by the likes of Smokebot and Bath Loader, among others.

Bumblebee replaced BazarLoader in Feb 2022. Its predecessor first appeared in April 2020, when developers behind Trickbot released BazarBackdoor. The loader component of this malware was dubbed BazarLoader. 


## Intel and Analysis
Bumblebee malware is in the loader family that is often used by threat actors to gain initial access to victim environments. It can be used to deliver a variety of payloads, including ransomware and other types of malware.

Key features and operational characteristics of BumbleBee include:
- Delivery Mechanism: Historically, BumbleBee was primarily distributed through phishing. Recently, however, it has also been distributed via trojanized installers for popular software such as Zoom, Cisco AnyConnect, ChatGPT, and Citrix Workspace, as observed by Counter Threat Unit‚Ñ¢ (CTU‚Ñ¢) researchers. These trojanized installers increase the likelihood of new infections as they are often associated with software currently in high demand or widely used by remote workers.
- SEO Poisoning and Malicious Ads: Cybercriminals have been using techniques like SEO poisoning and malicious Google Ads to distribute malware, including BumbleBee. For instance, legitimate web searches are hijacked by SEO poisoning to infect victims' systems. Malicious Google Ads have also been used to bundle infostealers like RedLine in trojanized installers for popular software.
- Unique Identifier: BumbleBee is identified by its unique user-agent "bumblebee".
- Payloads: BumbleBee fetches payloads from Cobalt Strike, as observed by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG). It is also a modular loader used to deliver payloads typically associated with ransomware deployments.
- Advanced Capabilities: BumbleBee malware can perform various tasks, including execution of shellcode, dropping and running executable files, and collecting system details for exfiltration to a Command and Control (C2) server.
- Post-Infection Activity: CTU researchers observed lateral movement within a compromised environment approximately three hours after a BumbleBee infection. The threat actor deployed Cobalt Strike, as well as legitimate AnyDesk and DameWare remote access tools. Persistence mechanisms such as a Scheduled Task named WindowsSensor15 were used for Cobalt Strike.
