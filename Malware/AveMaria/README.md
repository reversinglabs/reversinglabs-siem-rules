# AveMaria

AveMaria (aka WarzoneRAT) is a remote access trojan known to target Windows systems. AveMaria was first discovered in 2018 when it was identified as a malware-as-a-service offering. The malware has information stealing capabilities, such as stealing credentials via file/registry access and browser information.

AveMaria has been known to be particularly resourceful in altering its infection chain. Past implementations have made use of several techniques, including DLL hijacking, malicious VHD files, and more. AveMaria is generally distributed via phishing emails.
