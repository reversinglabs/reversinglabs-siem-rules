# QBot

QBot, known as Qakbot, QuackBot, and Pinkslipbot, first emerged as a banking trojan in 2007. Owned by the criminal gang BlackBasta and its affiliates, QBot's exceptional adaptability and capacity to exploit new malware strains have contributed to its reputation.

QBot acts as a general-purpose trojan to gain initial access. Once installed, it can move laterally and ensure persistence on the victimâ€™s system. Once QBot has a foothold, it will install other malware, such as Cobalt Strike. 

Typically, the infection pathway involves receiving an email with an attached file, such as a *.zip or .pdf, contaminated with concealed files (.wsf, *.js, *.msi). Consequently, a Qbot.dll file is installed on the victim's machine.

Additionally, when querying for network indicators, be aware that typical QBot Command and Control (C&C) servers on the Internet have short lifespans, usually lasting only a few days. Conducting daily scanning and implementing immediate mitigation measures is necessary to counter this threat.
