# GuLoader

GuLoader (also known as CloudEyE) is a sophisticated and evasive malware loader that has been used by cybercriminals to distribute various types of malicious payloads. Functioning as a "downloader" or "dropper," GuLoader's primary purpose is to deliver and install additional malware onto compromised systems. It typically downloads RATs/Stealers, such as Agent Tesla, Arkei/Vidar, Formbook, Lokibot, Netwire and Remcos, often but not always from Google Drive.

GuLoader employs advanced techniques to avoid detection by security software, making it a potent tool for spreading malicious software while evading traditional antivirus measures. GuLoader is often distributed through malicious email attachments, fake software updates, or compromised websites, taking advantage of social engineering tactics to trick users into executing the payload.
