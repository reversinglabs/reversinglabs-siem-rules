# AresLoader

AresLoader is a newer malware family that was first discovered in late 2022. 
AresLoader is a loader malware that uses a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) business model. 
Users of the malware have been seen pushing information stealers as part of pro-Russian hacktivism campaigns. 

The malware itself offers the basic functionality of other loader malwares, including
download and execution capabilities. AresLoader will generally attempt to gain persistence, 
usually by creating a scheduled task. Recent campaigns using AresLoader have show that the 
malware is masquerading as legitimate software, such as Revo Uninstaller or CCleaner.
