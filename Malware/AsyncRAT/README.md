# AsyncRAT

First released on GitHub in 2019, AsyncRAT is an open source Remote Administration Tool. 
It offers several capabilities including keylogging, remote control, webcam control, and more.
The author of AsyncRAT, NYAN-x-CAT, has written several malicious programs over the years, which are
shared on their GitHub profile and sold directly. 

AsyncRAT is often delivered via phishing campaigns, with recent examples using OneNote
files to evade user detection.
