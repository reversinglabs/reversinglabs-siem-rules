# Nanocore

Nanocore is a remote access trojan that was first identified in 2013. It is primarily used 
to spy on victims and steal information. Nanocore will perform basic functions like screen captures,
 remote control, and webcam monitoring, while also containing the ability to download additional modules as necessary.

Nanocore has been seen being used by both cybercriminals and nation state threat actors. In particular, APT33 
has been attributed as an operator of Nanocore malware.
