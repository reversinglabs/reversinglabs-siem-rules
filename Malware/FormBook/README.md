# FormBook

FormBook is a notorious infostealing malware that has been active since at least 2016. It is designed to steal sensitive information from infected systems, primarily by intercepting user input, such as keystrokes and data entered into online forms. This stolen information can include passwords, credit card details, email credentials, and other personal data, which cybercriminals can use for various malicious purposes, including identity theft, fraud, and unauthorized access.

FormBook has a variety of infection delivery mechanisms but is typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or compromised websites. Once a system becomes infected with FormBook, it begins looking for useful data to extract by injecting into processes and monitoring for keystrokes, taking screenshots, and more. Operators can also remotely control the malware.

Much like other info stealer malware, access to FormBook is sold on dark web marketplaces via a subscription model.
