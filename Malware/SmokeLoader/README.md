# Smoke Loader

Smoke Loader is a malicious bot application that has been seen since 2011. It is primarily used to download other malware. Much like other loaders, it generally appears via phishing and a malicious attachment. In addition to loader capabilities, SmokeLoader includes several plugins, including a keylogger, file search, and DDoS module. It should be noted that Smoke Loader is designed to ensure that the target systems are not Russian. As of 2023, Smoke Loader is still very much an active threat.
