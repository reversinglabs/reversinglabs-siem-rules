# Gozi/UrSnif

Gozi, also known as Ursnif, was created mid-2000s as a banking Trojan and information-stealing malware. Around 2020, like many other malware families (e.g., Trickbot, Dridex, Zloader), Gozi malware faced the reality that it's hard to commit banking fraud, and it became a loader for 2nd stage attack malware - often ransomware. 
 
Once Gozi infected a victim's system, it would establish a persistent presence by modifying the Windows Registry and injecting itself into legitimate processes to avoid detection. It employed advanced techniques to evade antivirus software and security measures, making it challenging to detect and remove.

## History
First detected in 2007, Gozi is thought to originate from Russia and has targeted customers of banks across Europe, North America, and Australia. The malware is distributed primarily through phishing attacks, where users are tricked into downloading a seemingly benign attachment, usually in the form of a PDF or Word document. Once the infected file is opened, the malware installs itself on the user's system.

Gozi has undergone several iterations over the years, with each version becoming more sophisticated. In addition to its data theft capabilities, some versions of Gozi have also included the ability to download additional malware onto an infected system.

In 2013, the creator of the Gozi malware was arrested and subsequently pleaded guilty to a variety of charges. Despite this, versions of the malware have continued to circulate, likely due to the source code being leaked online in 2010.
