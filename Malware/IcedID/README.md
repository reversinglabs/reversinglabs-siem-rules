# IcedID

**Also known as:** Bokbot, IceID

## Overview
IcedID started as a modular banking Trojan first discovered in 2017. Actors using IcedID have targeted financial institutions and other industries using spear-phishing emails, exploit kits, and malvertising campaigns. Its malicious C++ architecture employs process injection, process hollowing, and Command and Control (C2) channels for stealth and persistence. Over the years, IcedID has undergone various updates, moving on from being a banking trojan and more of a modular trojan for multi use purposes. It's also enhanced its distribution and attack capabilities, as well as its ability to evade detection. 

## Analysis
IcedID has various TTPs, including network propagation, local proxy traffic tunneling, web injection attacks, and sophisticated redirection attacks. Here's more information about its network propagation, local proxy traffic tunneling, web injection attacks, and sophisticated redirection attacks:
1. Network Propagation: IcedID has a network propagation module that enables it to move to other endpoints within a network. It queries the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to find other users to infect. This feature suggests that IcedID targets businesses and organizations, as it can spread laterally within a network, potentially causing more damage and data theft.
2. Local Proxy Traffic Tunneling: IcedID sets up a local proxy to listen and intercept communications from the victim's endpoint. It redirects all internet traffic through this proxy in two hops. First, the traffic is transferred to the localhost (127.0.0.1) via a dynamic/private TCP/IP port. Second, the malware's malicious process listens on that port and exfiltrates relevant communications to its C2 server. This traffic tunneling allows IcedID to monitor and control the victim's online activities.
3. Web Injection Attacks: In the past IcedID's web injection attacks are triggered when the user visits a target URL from the malware's configuration file. The malware executes a designated web injection that sends the victim to a fake bank site set up that matches the original site. The victim is tricked into submitting their credentials on the fake site, which sends the information to the attacker's server. From there, the attacker can control the victim's session and potentially use social engineering techniques to obtain additional sensitive information.
4. Sophisticated Redirection Attacks: In the past IcedID employed advanced redirection attacks that are designed to appear seamless to the victim. Unlike simple URL redirections, IcedID's scheme maintains a live connection with the actual bank's site, allowing the legitimate bank's URL and SSL certificate to be displayed in the address bar. This tactic makes it difficult for victims to recognize they are being redirected to a malicious site.

These advanced techniques allow IcedID to efficiently compromise and exploit its targets, posing a significant risk to businesses and individuals alike.
