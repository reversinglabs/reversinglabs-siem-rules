# AZORult

AZORult (also known as PuffStealer and Ruzalto) is an information stealer malware that was first discovered in 2016. It has similar attributes to other stealer malware in that it was sold on underground forums, can download additional modules, and is primarily delivered via phishing emails. Newer iterations of AZORult may have the ability to create local administrator accounts and use Remote Desktop Protocol for persistence. Notable operators of this malware family include the Gorgon Group.
