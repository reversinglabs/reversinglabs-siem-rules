# Black Basta

On February 25, 2022, Conti gang announced their full support to the Russian government over the Russia-Ukraine war and threatened to take retaliatory measures if anyone decided to organize a cyberattack against Russia. What happened afterwards was a hard lesson for all the ransomware threat groups, that a direct association or support to a nation state will result in the end of their business.
The Conti brand became toxic and the gang had to quickly adapt and move operations and resources to associated groups or subsidiaries. One of them was Black Basta.

Black Basta is ransomware as a service (RaaS) known for high velocity, double extortion operations targeting small to medium size businesses in North America and Western Europe.  
Like many other groups, they run their own name-and-shame blog with a purpose of creating additional reputational pressure to pay the ransom.

In the start, Black Basta was a pure data-stealing operation, like KaraKurt or BlackByte. 
With time and Conti support, it became what it is known for today - a double extortion ransomware group. It didn't take long after the merger that the first Black Basta ransomware attack was recorded in April 2022. From that time, there have been over 100+ successful attacks recorded worldwide.

Beside owning and developing their own ransomware capable of encrypting both Windows and Linux OS hosts, they rely heavily on QBot for Initial Access.
In their toolset, there are well known usual suspects like Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, SystemBC, legit RMM software like Atera or TeamViewer and other command line tools.
